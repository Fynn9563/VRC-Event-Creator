# Changelog

All notable changes to VRChat Event Creator will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Calendar Integration** — Generate .ics calendar invite files with configurable reminders when VRChat events are created
  - Per-template and per-event "Create .ics Calendar Invite" toggle with reminder configuration
  - Preset reminder intervals (5min to 1 week) compatible with Outlook, Apple Calendar, and other clients
  - Reminders sorted longest-first for best compatibility with single-reminder clients
  - Discord webhook delivery: posts a rich embed with event details, banner image, group icon, and .ics file attachment
  - Discord embed uses unix timestamps (each viewer sees their local timezone) and language-agnostic emoji labels
  - .ics files always auto-save to a local directory when calendar is enabled
  - Local save dialog for manual .ics export
  - Deterministic ICS UIDs for update-safe re-delivery
  - Per-group webhook URL configuration with test/verify button (encrypted storage)
- **EC Kit** — Webhook identity customization for groups with an active license
  - Custom webhook display name, avatar URL, and embed color per group
  - Per-template and per-event custom webhook message textarea and image attachment
  - Pending automated events can have custom message/image edited before posting
  - Ed25519 signed license verification (offline, public key in app)
  - Import button in Discord Integration per-group settings
- Calendar integration setting under Advanced Settings
- Translations for all new strings across all 10 supported languages

### Changed
- **Decoupled posting options** — Discord scheduled events, Discord webhook posts, and .ics calendar file generation are now three independent toggles
  - "Create Discord Event" — creates a Discord scheduled event (requires bot token + guild ID)
  - "Post Discord Webhook" — posts to a Discord webhook (requires webhook URL, independent of Discord events and calendar)
  - "Create .ics Calendar Invite" — generates and auto-saves an .ics file (independent of webhook and Discord events)
  - When webhook and calendar are both enabled, .ics is attached to the webhook post and also auto-saved
  - When webhook and Discord event are both enabled, webhook message includes the Discord event link
  - Kit custom message/image fields now depend only on the webhook toggle being enabled
- "Sync to Discord" renamed to "Create Discord Event" across all languages
- Webhook URL field in Discord settings now visible when Discord integration is enabled (previously required calendar)
- Calendar setup guides rewritten for all 10 languages to reflect the decoupled architecture
- Linux build now uses .ico icon (electron-builder auto-converts to PNG)

## [1.1.3] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Status pill "Resync" hover text now displays in the active language instead of always showing English
- Added `common.resync` translation key to all 10 language files

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Disabled CSS `text-transform: uppercase` for CJK languages (Japanese, Chinese, Korean) so Latin brand names like "Discord" render with their original casing instead of all-caps

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Resync button now also checks GitHub for app updates

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-08

  - "Verify Bot Token" button to test bot connectivity before saving

### Changed

- Existing templates default to Discord sync off (must opt in); new templates and manual events default to on

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Automation engine now regenerates pending events after each successful automated post, making automation self-sustaining instead of stopping after the initial batch
- "After" timing mode no longer gets permanently stuck when publish times fall in the past due to stale state — recovers by scheduling 5 minutes from now if the event is still in the future
- Automation now reconciles scheduled pending events against existing VRChat events to prevent duplicate posting (matches on start time, title, description, category, and access type)
